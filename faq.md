##### My book is not being updated / I can't see any builds

If you linked your book to a GitHub repository but editing content doesn't trigger any build,
verify that the webhook has been correctly added to your GitHub repository (in your GitHub repository's settings -> Webhook). If the webhook is not present or invalid, add it back from your book's settings.

If you **changed the book's name or its owner's name** (it happens when transferring your book to a new owner), the webhook is now invalid, you need to add it back.
