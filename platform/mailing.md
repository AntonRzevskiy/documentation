# Messaging

GitBook integrates an easy messagign and newsletter feature to help author communicate efficiently with readers.

### Newsletter

Readers and visitors can subscribe to a mailing list to get notifications about content updates (and even custom messages from authors).

The newsletter form can be integrated easily into a book homepage (already present in the default homepage theme).
