# Searching GitBook

You can use [our powerful search tools](https://www.gitbook.com/search) to find what you're looking for among thousands of books on GitBook.

When searching GitBook, you can construct queries that match specific numbers and words.


### Search by text

By default, GitBook search books associated with the keywords from the query. For example `javascript angular` will return all the books that contain the word "javascript" and "angular"

### Exclude results containing a certain word

You can also narrow your search results by excluding words with the `NOT` syntax. Searching for `Hello` returns a massive number of "Hello World" projects, but changing your search to include `hello NOT world` returns fewer results.
