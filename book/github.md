# GitHub Integration

GitBook integrates perfectly with [GitHub](https://github.com) as a host for the source of your book.

To integrate your book with GitHub, you need to authorize GitBook to access your GitHub account to some extent. From your [account's settings](https://www.gitbook.com/settings), connect your GitHub account and choose what you will allow:

- **Default permissions**: Allows you to log in with GitHub to your GitBook account.
- **Access to public repositories**: Allows editing books on your public GitHub repositories from the GitBook Web editor.
- **Access to private repositories**: Same as above, but for private repositories too.
- **Access to webhook**: Allows GitBook to create webhooks on your book repositories to trigger builds when the GitHub repository is updated (See [webhooks](book/webhooks)).
