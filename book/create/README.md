# Creating or importing books

When creating books, your are prompted with several alternatives:

- Create from a template like _Basic_, or _Science_ (already configured to use `mathjax`)
- Import a book from GitHub (see [hosting on GitHub](/book/github.md#importing-from-an-existing-github-repository)), or other git repositories
- Import from a document ([detailed process here](import-documents.md))
