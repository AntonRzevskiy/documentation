# Transferring content to GitHub

If you started writing your book on GitBook and you now want to host its source on GitHub, don't worry, it's easy:

1. Use the **Import Tool** from GitHub:  [import.github.com/new](https://import.github.com/new)
2. Enter your GitBook git url, for example: `https://git.gitbook.com/MyName/MeBook.git}` (this url can be found in your book settings).
3. Enter a name for your GitHub repository.
4. Enter your GitBook credentials (you can use your API token instead of your password) when prompted.
5. Done!

When your content as been transferred to GitHub, you can now setup the integration so taht GitBook can still build your book from GitHub: [GitHub Integration](./README.md)
