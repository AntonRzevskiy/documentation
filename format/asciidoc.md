# AsciiDoc

Since version `2.0.0`, GitBook can also accept AsciiDoc as an input format.

Please refer to the [AsciiDoc Syntax Quick Reference](http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/) for more informations about the format.

Just like for markdown, GitBook is using some special files to extract structures: `README.adoc`, `SUMMARY.adoc`, `LANGS.adoc` and `GLOSSARY.adoc`.
