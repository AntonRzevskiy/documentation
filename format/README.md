# Format

The format's main focus is simplicity and readability.

GitBook uses a convention on top of markup files:

* [**README**](./readme.md): Introduction of the book
* [**SUMMARY**](./chapters.md): Chapters Structure
* [**LANGS**](./languages.md): Multi-Languages book
* [**GLOSSARY**](./glossary.md): List of terms with descriptions

A book needs at least a `README` and a `SUMMARY`.
